###  Why Rust?
I added Rust to my tech stack to bring a vibrant **Orange** touch to my GitHub language bar and to explore the world of memory safety and systems programming.

###  How to Play:
To run the mini-game in this repository, follow these steps:
1. Ensure you have **Rust** installed on your system.
2. Open your terminal (ThinkPad/Termux).
3. Compile the file:  
   `rustc main.rs`
4. Run the executable:  
   `./main` (Linux/Termux) or `main.exe` (Windows)
